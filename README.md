Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer with a specialization in JavaScript. I am passionate about applying critical thinking skills to solve problems and challenging myself to learn and implement new technology strategies. I have experience working collaboratively with other engineers to build modern and intuitive solutions that help businesses succeed.

My tech stack and background includes JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, MongoDB, Mongoose, Cassandra, Redis, AWS EC2/S3 and more. While I am continuing to enhance my software engineering skills and learn new ones, I am seeking full-time employment.
